## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

enve2d a fork of [enve](https://github.com/MaurycyLiebner/enve) changed it's name to Friction and moved to **[github.com/friction2d](https://github.com/friction2d)**. Sorry about the potential confusion.

If the enve project wants this org just let me [know](https://github.com/rodlie) and I will give you full access, else it will be deleted after a while.
